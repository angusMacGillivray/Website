                        Hello and welcome to my website. My name is Angus MacGillivray and I am 18 years old as of creating this website. I currently attend dalhousie university. I hava many goals in life, but my main goal is to become the best
                        version of myself that I can. I have many hobbies, but my main 2 hobbies are video games and rock climbing. In 
                        the future I want to work in the tech field, and hopefully I can find a job that I can work remotly since I do not 
                        want to go into a office everyday, however if I cant find a remote job I do not mind going into an office. The
                        goal of this website is to show off some of my HTML skills, people learning aboutme, some funny videos and pictures
                        to make your day.
